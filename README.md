# Marvel Quiz with Python!
TODO: Create Marvel Quiz Game with Python. Choose four marvel characters and create the questions that will describe a given character. Store the character names in an array or list and create an interactive quiz; figure out which Marvel character is the “answer”.
Create a [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJPEf00AReeHOUY4KTg2uVpMasfsifyWWeS3DoVTdcw/edit?usp=sharing "Google Doc") to track the progress.

## Quiz Game
Pick the marvel characters in your head and make the computer guess who the Marvel character you thought of in your head was.

### Prerequisites
All you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/ "python link") to play.

### Usage
TODO: Clone the project, <code>cd</code> to your directory/download, and run the quiz.py file in a Python 3 shell (Terminal on a mac / Linux, Windows command prompt).

### Rules

Same as the quiz game that you know:
